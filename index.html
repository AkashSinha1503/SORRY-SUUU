                Hey I Aplogise for whatsoever happened but cant live apart from you. <br><br>



                I love you so much that I feel you in my heart in every moment of my life. It's like you're right next to me when I wake up in the morning, you say good morning to me when I turn off my alarm. When I lie down, I take you in my arms and I fall asleep stroking your hair. You can't even imagine how they made me feel, because even I am surprised how I can fall in love with myself ☺️.
                <br><br>

                I dream of you with me when I go somewhere. You hold my hand while walking in the park, we listen to the birds chirping together. While hugging by the lake, ducks come and bother us 🙄. heheh. But everything is fine with you my darling, and my heart beats at an incredible rate even while I'm dreaming of these, I guess the feelings I'll feel next to you will never be counted 🥺 <br><br>

                My naughty darling ❤️. I love the things you do, you are so talented that everything you do, every work you touch turns out to be perfect. I love the Dance you do everytime 🥺, now I remember the first time I saw it... My eyes filled with brightness because it was so beautiful 😭. (I hope you like the things I prepared using my skills ☺️.) My dear suu...
                <br> <br>

                , I love it, I'm done with you. Your face, your nose, your eyes... those honey lips 😋. I want to kiss those lips, hold your beautiful hands and hug your safe arms. Hopefully it will all happen soon. I also love your body. You are the definition of perfection, my eyes are dazzled when I look at you, my heart is held, my soul finds peace 😇...
                <br><br>

                I guess I need to finish this article slowly now. I love you so much darling ❤️. I hope we will have better days than the previous ones, I hope we will be happier than we have ever been, together from now on... I want so much that I want to spend my life with you... I hope this Apology will make some change in the situation and whatsoever was the past and whatever will be the future but the truth is that you are everything to me in this present time for this present Akash....<br><br>

                Let me end with a little poem. English but okay heheh.
                <br><br>

Bewitched by the fire in your eyes<br>
Locked in the castle 'tis your heart<br>
Your soul I see when I look for the light<br>
And by your side I want to be all night<br>

                <br>
                
You nurse me when I'm feeling sick<br>
Talk to me when I'm feeling weak<br>
Your skin is my healing lotion<br>
Your kiss is the love potion <br>
<br>
I am really sorry... I never wanted to hurt you anyway and i am trying to be like to the man of your dreams suuu...  ❤️ 😘<br>
